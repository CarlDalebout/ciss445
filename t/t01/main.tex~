There are two parts. Part 1 is close-book and in-class and Part 2 is open-book
and take-home. Part 1 and Part 2 are both worth 50% of the midterm grade.
No discussion is allowed for either case.

Your solution must be written in the box provided. Anything outside the box
is not considered part of the solution.
Everything inside the box IS considered part of the solution.

Do NOT provide multiple solutions. If you do, I get to pick ONE to grade.
(I'm very good at picking solution -- the wrong one).

Write neatly. If I cannot read your solution easily you will get zero.

\textbf{Part 1.}

Q1. [Phases of compilation] The following are the phases in source code compilation:

\end{center}

(a) What is the input for the scanner phase?
\\ \SOLUTION
\begin{console}


  
\end{console}

(b) What is the output during the scanner phase?
\\ \SOLUTION
\begin{console}


  
\end{console}

(c) What is the input for the parser phase?
\\ \SOLUTION
\begin{console}


  
\end{console}

(d) What is the output during the parser phase?
\\ \SOLUTION
\begin{console}


  
\end{console}


\newpage
For the OCAML coding problems,
your grade will be based on passing a lists of tests cases.
If your code passes all the test cases,
you get all the points for that question;
if it does not pass any test cases you will get 0.
Not all test cases are shown below.

Q2. [Basic function definition for higher order function]
\\
Write a function quadratic such that
\verb!(quadratic a b c)! returns a function that computes the $y$-value
of the straight quadratic equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.
For instance 

\begin{console}[frame=none]
        Test                       Expected value
        (quadratic 0 1 2) 5        0 * 5 * 5 + 1 * 5 + 2
        (quadratic 1 2 3) 3        1 * 3 * 3 + 2 * 3 + 3
        (quadratic 2 3 4) 7        2 * 7 * 7 + 3 * 7 + 4
\end{console}

\SOLUTION
\begin{console}






  
\end{console}

\newpage
Q3. [Basic function definition and pattern matching]
\\
Write a \verb!head!
function that returns the first value of a list.
Ignore the case where the list is empty.

\begin{console}[frame=none]
	Test            Expected value
	head [1]        1
	head [2;9]      2
	head [3;2;5]    3
\end{console}

SOLUTION
\begin{console}







  
\end{console}


\newpage
Q4.
[Recursion on lists and pattern matching]
\\
Write a function at so that (reverse_at list n) returns the element of the list at index n in the order, i.e., index 0 means the last value, index 1 means the second last value, etc.. Ignore the case where n<0 or n>= the size of the list.

	Test		Expected values
	reverse_at [5;3;1]  0	1
	reverse_at [2;4;6]  1	4
	reverse_at [1;3;5;7]  3	1
